Hello, 

While at home for quarantine, we are urged to continue learning. 

This site is for my students under the following blocks: 

- Group 13 Phys1235, 03:00 PM - 04:30 PM (MW) D214TC
- Group 2 Phys1235, 07:30 AM - 09:00 AM (TTh) D215TC

I've made all the materials for learning available online in the **[Lecture Notes](https://phys1235.github.io/lecture-notes/)** section. The lecture notes are available in pdf format one for each topic. For each lecture notes, there is a corresponding problem set and a corresponding link for submissions of your answers. 

| Problem Set # | Due Date      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Problem Set 1 | 21 April 2020 |
| Problem Set 2 | 28 April 2020 |
| Problem Set 3 | 04 May 2020   |

For the **Problem Set**, each problem is provided with a correct answer. Your task is provide a clean and clear solution which can be submitted on the appropriate due date. 
The submission deadline is not really strict. You can submit it anytime. The output can be submitted when *the situation becomes stable*. I trust you to be a responsible learner. 

Stay safe!
