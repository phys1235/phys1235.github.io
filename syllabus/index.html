<p><b>Description</b><br>
</p>
<p>
The PHYS 1235 course, a 3-unit course, is a required Physics course for Engineering students. This service course intends to develop appreciation and strong foundation in Physics for their advanced engineering courses.
The course covers topics on Mechanics - the study of relationships among force, matter and motion. As the first physics course for the engineering students, the lessons start off with a review on kinematics and vectors, with the assumption that they have tackled these during their senior high school. To understand the underlying causes of motion, kinematics is then related to dynamics of motion which is associating motion and forces as summarized by Newton’s three laws of motion and their applications. As there are several approaches in dealing with motion problems, the concepts of work and energy are also introduced which stems from the principles of conservation of energy. The scope of the study is extended to include rotational motion of extended bodies and conditions for static equilibrium, and fluid mechanics (i.e. fluid statics and fluid flow). The course also covers circuits by applying the concepts of Kirchhoff’s Rules in determining the current, voltage difference, and power output.
